Welcome to capstone's documentation!
====================================

**capstone** is a Graphical User Interface for classifying tumors as either benign or malignant based on medical images. It allows the user to load selected DICOM files and have a machine learning model predict whether the tumor is malignant or not. This GUI then proceeds to plot the results and separate the results based on the categorical parameters of the patient.
